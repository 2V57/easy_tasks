ðŸ“‹ About the List Interface in Java
List is an interface in Java that is part of the Collection Framework. It represents an ordered collection of elements, where each element has a specific position (index) in the list.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features of the List Interface:
Ordered elements:
Elements in a List are stored in the order they were added. The insertion order is preserved, and each element has a corresponding index.

Index support:
Each element in the list has an index, starting from 0. You can access, modify, or remove elements by their index.

Duplicate values allowed:
A List allows duplicate elements. Identical values can be added multiple times and are stored as separate entries.

Dynamic size:
The size of a List can change dynamically. You can add or remove elements at any time.

ðŸ’¡ Common implementations of List include ArrayList, LinkedList, and Vector.
