🔁 Array Reversing in Java
📋 Task Description:
You are assigned to create a method that reverses a given array of integers in place.
This task demonstrates the basics of working with arrays, data manipulation, and highlights the importance of algorithm efficiency when handling large volumes of data.

🎯 Goal:
Implement a Java program that defines a method to reverse an array of integers.
This exercise allows developers to practice using loops, working with arrays, and managing references.

✅ Requirements:
Create a class named Example.

Inside this class, implement a method called reverse that takes an array of integers as a parameter.

The method should reverse the given array in place (i.e., without creating a new array).

🧪 Example:
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Example.reverse(nums);
// Now nums = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
🛠️ Method Signature:
public static void reverse(int[] array)
